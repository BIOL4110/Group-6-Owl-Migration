## Introduction

Previous studies have linked anthropogenic climate change to widespread shifts in species' geographic distribution and migratory behaviour 
(La Sorte & Thompson, 2007. Brommer et al., 2012). Although there is variation in response, among migratory bird species climate change has 
widely resulted in latitudinal range shifts north (Brommer et al., 2012). A study of 32 North American bird species found that all study species
experienced Northward shifts in mean breeding latitude, and northern leading range margins (Rushing et al., 2020). Understanding habitat shift
is crucial as it affects not only species survival and reproduction but ecosystem dynamics, predator-prey relationships, and conservation strategies.
This field is essential to informing biodiversity management, particularly as changing climates push species beyond their historical ranges, complicating
existing conservation frameworks (Tomas, 2010).  

Snowy Owls (*Bubo scandiacus*), a migratory bird with an extensive range (Fink et al., 2022), could provide important insight into how future variations
in climate affect species habitat and survival. Much of the species’ range, notably breeding, is located in the Arctic, where the average temperature has
risen at a rate of almost four times the global average (Rantanen et al., 2022). This may make Snowy Owls a particularly strong indicator species for climate change.

### Key Uncertainty

Previous studies have focused on tracking this species' migratory behaviour and irruptive movements (Fuller et al., 2003). Significant uncertainty remains
about the specific drivers of these movements in the context of climate change. Lemmings are often considered a factor in Snowy Owl migration. In years when
lemming populations reach high densities, large numbers of young Snowy Owls migrate south during their first winter, generally called an irruption migration,
(Holt, et al., 2024). The highly variable nature of Snowy Owl migration leaves gaps in our understanding of how climate-driven changes in temperature influence
this species. As such we lack clear data on how climate variability may influence long-term population dynamics and survival. This study addresses this gap by
exploring the relationship between temperature fluctuations and the habitat range of the Snowy Owls, focusing on observations in Canada and the United States.
We raise the question: How do increasing temperatures in non-breeding ranges affect the geographic range and migration of Snowy Owls in North America?

### Hypothesis and Prediction

This study tests the hypothesis that species' geographical ranges are determined by their organismal responses to temperature. This study predicts that increasing
temperatures in wintering non-breeding ranges will shift the geographic range of snowy owls' habitat northward as the species track their preferred climate zone
poleward. For example, from 2000 to 2023, we expect snowy owl abundance to decrease in lower latitude grids and increase in higher latitude grids in response to
anthropogenic warming. Snowy owls’ range shift in response to temperature increases may be delayed following temperature change. We expect range shifts to vary
with the amount of warming, and therefore to differ across longitudes, which experience different amounts of warming.
