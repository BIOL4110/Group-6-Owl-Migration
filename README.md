## Data Analysis Replication

We used three separate R files to run our full analysis.<br>
This is all we used along with our data files stored on the OSF to test our hypothesis.<br>
They have been number in order of how to run them,

1, Temperature_code (notebook)

2, Preping_the_data (script)

3, Model_making (script)


Each script is fully anotated on how it works and which variables need to be changed.

**If PAT in the code does not work please go to this [link](https://osf.io/settings/tokens/) to create your own**
