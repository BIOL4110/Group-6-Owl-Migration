## Data Analysis Replication

We used three separate R files in order to run our full analysis.
They have been number in order of how to run them,

1, Temperature_code (notebook)

2, Preping_the_data (script)

3, Model_making (script)


Each script is fully anotated on how it works and which variables need to be changed.
